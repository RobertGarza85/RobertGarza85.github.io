    "Hi, I'm Naya Singhania! I've been passionate about CS since I was 12, and that enthusiasm has driven me to explore various technologies and frameworks since then. I'm currently working towards a Computer Science degree as well as a Computational Linguistics certificate at SJSU, where I've deepened my understanding of CS fundamentals and honed my skills in Next.js and React. I mainly create dynamic fullstack applications with AI integration and seamless user experiences, and I'm always eager to learn and adapt to new challenges.",
    "In addition to my development work, I have a deep interest in AI and using it in production apps. For instance, I am developing a full-stack application that allows users to find and rate locations based on accessibility features that uses AI to get users the info they need. As someone who has a disability I hope that this project will help make life more accessible for those with disabilities. I also developed ChairSense, a project that utilizes various sensors and a microcontroller to implement obstacle detection on wheelchairs,  showcasing my commitment to leveraging technology for accessibility. Beyond my own projects, I ensure to support the open source community with open source contributions, and I am passionate about choir and producing music, where I express my creativity and connect with others.",

    "As I continue my journey in tech, I'm actively seeking internship opportunities that will allow me to further develop my skills and gain hands-on experience. If you're looking for a dedicated and enthusiastic developer with a strong foundation in Fullstack + AI development and a passion for innovation, let's connect! I'm excited to collaborate and explore new possibilities in the tech world."
